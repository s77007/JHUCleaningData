## Course Project - Getting and Cleaning Data
(<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata">Coursera.org, Johns Hopkins University, Data Science Specialization</a>)

The purpose of this project is to summarize specific variables recorded by accelerometers from Samsung Galaxy S phones.  Data are provided by the University of California - Irvine Machine Learning Repository.  Original datasets are not included in this Github repository due to filesize.  They can be found <a href='http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones'>here</a> along with more information on the data.

## Files

* CodeBook.md - Document describing all manipulations of data performed in run_analysis.R and output variables to TidyData.txt.

* run_analysis.R - R code that manipulates UCI smartphone accelerometer dataset as required by course.  More information on this file can be found in CodeBook.md.

* TidyData.txt - Output dataset summarizing certain accelerometer variables by subject (person carrying smartphone) and by activity.  More information on this dataset can be found in CodeBook.md.
